1. Variable pi and Checking its Data Type

# Create a variable named pi
pi = 22 / 7

# Check the data type of the variable
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))

2. Variable Named for

# Try to create a variable called 'for'
for = 4

What Happens?

You will get a SyntaxError: invalid syntax.


Reason:

In Python, for is a reserved keyword used for loops. You cannot use reserved keywords as variable names.


To resolve this, use a different name, such as:

# Use a valid variable name
for_value = 4
print(for_value)

3. Calculate Simple Interest

# Store principal, rate, and time in variables
P = 10000  # Principal amount in dollars
R = 5      # Rate of interest in percentage
T = 3      # Time in years

# Calculate Simple Interest
SI = (P * R * T) / 100

# Print the result
print("Simple Interest:", SI)
